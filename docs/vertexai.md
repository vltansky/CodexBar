# Vertex AI provider

## Data sources + fallback order
1) **OAuth via gcloud ADC** (only path used in `fetch()`):
   - Reads `application_default_credentials.json` from the gcloud config directory.
   - Uses Cloud Monitoring time-series metrics to compute quota usage.

## OAuth credentials
- Authenticate: `gcloud auth application-default login`.
- Project: `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`.
- Fallback project env vars: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GCLOUD_PROJECT`, `CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT`.

## API endpoints
- Cloud Monitoring timeSeries:
  - Usage: `serviceruntime.googleapis.com/quota/allocation/usage`
  - Limit: `serviceruntime.googleapis.com/quota/limit`
  - Resource: `consumer_quota` with `service="aiplatform.googleapis.com"`.

## Mapping
- Matches usage + limit series by quota metric + limit name + location.
- Reports the highest usage percent across matched series.
- Displayed as "Quota usage" with period "Current quota".

## Token Cost Tracking
- Cost is calculated from local Claude usage logs (same as Claude provider).
- Reads `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` files for Claude model usage.
- Displays daily and 30-day cost estimates in USD.
- Enable "Show cost summary" in Settings → General to see cost data.

## Troubleshooting
- **No quota data**: Ensure Cloud Monitoring API access in the selected project.
- **No cost data**: Check that `~/.claude/projects/` exists and contains `.jsonl` files from Claude Code usage.
- **Auth issues**: Re-run `gcloud auth application-default login`.
